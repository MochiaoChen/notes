# The problem with gamifying life | The Gray Area

### 第一章：开场与游戏的终极定义 (00:00:00 - 00:02:54)

[00:00:00]
Sean (Host): hey what's up i'm sean host of the gray area we have a fantastic show for you this week i'm talking to the philosopher ct nuen who wrote a book called the score it is one of the best and most surprisingly profound books i've read maybe in years uh the book has a philosophy of games but what it's really about is the gamification of life how we've turned everything we do and almost every domain of life into metrics and scores and numbers and how that sort of like drains all the fun and joy out of so much of what we do it's a great conversation i know you're going to love it check it out and i'll see you next time ct newin welcome to the show

Sean (主持人): 大家好，我是Sean，《灰色地带》的主持人。本周我们为大家准备了一期非常精彩的节目。我将与哲学家 C. Thi Nguyen 交谈，他写了一本书（注：探讨分数与指标）。这是我近几年来读过的最好、最出人意料深刻的书之一。这本书包含了一种游戏哲学，但它真正探讨的是生活的游戏化——我们如何将我们所做的一切，几乎是生活的每一个领域，都变成了指标、分数和数字，以及这种做法是如何抽干了我们许多行为中的乐趣和喜悦的。这是一次很棒的对话，我知道你们会喜欢的。去听听看吧，我们下次再见。C. Thi Nguyen，欢迎来到节目。
 
[00:00:43]

C. Thi Nguyen (Guest): hello it's good to be here

C. Thi Nguyen (嘉宾): 你好，很高兴来到这里。

[00:00:43]

Sean: i'm so glad you're here um i'm just going to ask a very basic question out of the gates here to to get us going what is a game on the most fundamental level how do you define it nice and simple right

Sean: 我很高兴你能来。一开场我要先问一个非常基础的问题，让我们进入正题：在最根本的层面上，什么是游戏？你如何定义它？很简单直接，对吧？

[00:00:58]

C. Thi Nguyen: yeah uh for me uh the most beautiful and useful definition of a game comes from uh the philosopher bernard suits he was kind of this like cult figure who wrote this book called the grasshopper in the 70s and his definition of a game is that a game playing a game is voluntarily undertaking unnecessary obstacles in order to create the experience of struggling to overcome them

C. Thi Nguyen: 是的。对我来说，关于游戏最美妙、最有用的定义来自哲学家 Bernard Suits。他有点像个受人崇拜的标杆人物，在70年代写了一本叫《蚱蜢》的书。他对游戏的定义是：玩游戏就是自愿承担不必要的障碍，为了创造出努力克服这些障碍的体验。

[00:01:21]

Sean: and why do we get off on that so much what is the purpose of that why do we like having obstacles and then that feeling of navigating and conquering them what is that doing for us

Sean: 那为什么我们对此如此着迷？这有什么目的？为什么我们喜欢有障碍，然后喜欢那种驾驭并征服它们的感觉？这能给我们带来什么？

[00:01:33]

C. Thi Nguyen: so the reason you play games is actually different in every game like um there are some party games that i play to like chill out with my friends to take the edge off uh there are some games i play because like the thought process is so interesting like coming up with that calculation figuring out that perfect move in go or chess or like reacting at just the right moment to like block a shot and like mario like uh in smash brothers is perfect and i think the thing that unites everything i've just said is that the pleasure the value the glory is in the process of acting and not the outcome

C. Thi Nguyen: 其实你玩每一款游戏的原因都是不同的。比如，我玩一些派对游戏是为了和朋友们放松一下，缓解压力；我玩另外一些游戏是因为它的思考过程太有趣了，比如在围棋或国际象棋中进行计算，想出那完美的一步，或者在恰当的时刻做出反应去格挡攻击，比如在《任天堂明星大乱斗》里的马里奥就非常完美。我认为，把刚才我说的所有这些统一起来的核心是：快乐、价值和荣耀存在于行动的过程之中，而不是结果。

[00:02:09]

C. Thi Nguyen: and that i think is one of the things that burner t's definition really revealed to me either you think that being involved in the process doing it feeling yourself doing it being in the process of figuring out talking to other people pushing against other people cooperating with other people either you think that can be beautiful in and of itself or you think that games are useless and insane and that half the time what people are doing just makes no sense

C. Thi Nguyen: 这也是 Bernard Suits 的定义向我揭示的重要一点。你要么认为：参与到这个过程中，去行动，感受自己在行动，处于弄清楚问题、与他人交谈、与他人对抗或合作的过程中——你要么认为这些过程本身就是美好的；你要么就会觉得游戏是无用且疯狂的，觉得人们一半的时间里在做的事情根本毫无意义。

[00:02:36]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i think that's i mean i kind of think that by the time you get to that point you you've gone down this alternate rabbit hole the rabbit hole of thinking that only outcomes only products only like stuff we make that we can hold in our hand is valuable

C. Thi Nguyen: 我的意思是，如果你觉得游戏毫无意义，那你其实已经掉进了另一个兔子洞——这个兔子洞让你误以为：只有结果，只有产出，只有我们创造出来并能握在手里的实体东西才是有价值的。

### 第二章：攀岩、飞蝇钓与心流的本质 (00:02:54 - 00:10:15)

[00:02:54]

Sean: this is probably like asking you who your favorite kid is but do you have a favorite game these days

Sean: 这个问题可能就像问你最喜欢你的哪个孩子一样，但你最近有最喜欢的游戏吗？

[00:03:02]

C. Thi Nguyen: for me the most beautiful game is rock climbing just the the carefulness and the intensity that you have to focus on your body and your balance and how you move in relation to the rock like that is an extraordinary experience for me

C. Thi Nguyen: 对我来说最美的游戏是攀岩。你需要将极度的谨慎和专注力集中在你的身体、平衡感以及你相对于岩石的移动方式上，这对我来说是一种非凡的体验。

[00:03:16]

Sean: it's interesting that you mentioned rock climbing as a game okay um i imagine a lot of people wouldn't think of something like that as a game they would think of it as i don't know an activity a hobby whatever what makes it a game

Sean: 很有趣你把攀岩说成是一种游戏。我想很多人不会把它看作游戏，他们可能觉得它就是一种……我不知道，一种活动或者爱好之类的。是什么让它成为了一种游戏？

[00:03:28]

C. Thi Nguyen: so again this is like this is the this is burner suits definition that i think is so clarifying for suits a game is anything where the constraints are the obstacles are central to what you're doing in some sense they're like the reason you're doing it and that that's true of video games right

C. Thi Nguyen: 所以我要再次回到 Bernard Suits 的定义，我认为这非常清晰。对 Suits 来说，任何将限制和障碍作为核心元素的活动都是游戏。在某种意义上，这些障碍就是你做这件事的原因。电子游戏也是如此，对吧？

[00:03:47]

C. Thi Nguyen: if you buy a puzzle game and you just like hack it and jump to the end without going through the struggle you haven't you haven't done the thing you haven't played the game if you get to the if you get to the finish line of a marathon uh by taking a taxi you haven't played the game if you climb a ladder if you use a ladder to get to the top of a rock climb you haven't done the thing that's valuable right

C. Thi Nguyen: 如果你买了一个解谜游戏，然后你直接破解它，跳到结局，而没有经历那种绞尽脑汁挣扎的过程，你就没有在做这件事，你并没有在玩游戏。如果你跑马拉松时打车到了终点，你也没有在玩这个游戏。如果你在攀岩时使用梯子爬到了顶端，你并没有做那件有价值的事情，对吧？

[00:04:08]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i think this is this is the interesting thing i mean i'm a philosopher and philosophers will endlessly argue about whether this definition is exactly right and there's kind of a sense in which i don't care right like it doesn't really matter if this idea that toots has of doing things for this for the obstacle of creating struggles voluntarily i think it's pretty close to our natural language concept of a game

C. Thi Nguyen: 我觉得这很有趣。我是个哲学家，哲学家们会无休止地争论这个定义是否完全准确，但在某种意义上我根本不在乎。这就没那么重要。Suits 提出的“为了自愿创造挣扎体验而去做事”的这个概念，我认为已经非常接近我们在自然语言中对“游戏”的理解了。

[00:04:32]

C. Thi Nguyen: but i don't care if it's exactly right what i care is that he's like pointed to this thing that is an essential part of human life and like delineated this like perfectly useful little category of the things that we do where the constraints and the obstacles are central to why we find it valuable and if you ask yourself why you do those things then then the answer has to be that it's it's something in the doing itself

C. Thi Nguyen: 但我不在乎它是否百分百准确。我在乎的是，他指出了这是人类生活中必不可少的一部分，并且完美地勾勒出了一个有用的小分类：在这些活动中，限制和障碍正是我们发现其价值的核心原因。如果你问自己为什么要去做这些事，答案必然是：价值就在于“做”的过程本身。

[00:04:57]

Sean: so something like climbing or even fly fishing which you write about kind of beautifully in the book i have probably not spent more than 10 seconds of my life thinking about fly fishing but reading about it in your book made me want to go fucking fly fish tomorrow um but what that has in common with something like climbing is it creates this space for total immersion you know total presence you know the flow state right like the happiness is kind of just in the doing in the way it makes you feel there's no for the sake of

Sean: 所以像攀岩，甚至像飞蝇钓——你在书里把飞蝇钓写得非常优美。我这辈子大概都没花超过10秒钟去想过飞蝇钓这回事，但在你的书里读到它之后，我他妈明天就想去飞蝇钓了。不过它和攀岩的共同点在于，它创造了一个让你完全沉浸的空间，也就是完全的临在感，或者说“心流”状态，对吧？那种快乐就存在于做的过程中，在于它给你的感受，而不是“为了达到某种目的”。

[00:05:31]

Sean: now we tend to lump all these sorts of activities under the umbrella of play uh do we call it play because it's doing something for its own sake um as god and aristotle intended or for some other reason

Sean: 现在我们倾向于把所有这类活动统称为“游玩 (play)”。我们之所以称之为游玩，是因为它就是为了做这件事本身而做吗？就像上帝和亚里士多德所期望的那样，还是有其他原因？

[00:05:47]

C. Thi Nguyen: i mean let me go back for a second i just want to talk can i just talk about fly fishing for a second i'm like in my basement right now i haven't fly fished in like a month and i crave it intensely um fly fishing i think is a really good example uh i mean the experience of fly fishing for me is super interesting

C. Thi Nguyen: 让我稍微退一步。我能先聊聊飞蝇钓吗？我现在坐在地下室里，我已经大概一个月没去飞蝇钓了，我极度渴望去。飞蝇钓我认为是一个非常好的例子。对我来说，飞蝇钓的体验极其有趣。

[00:06:11]

C. Thi Nguyen: like part of what makes fly fishing the sport it is for me is that it requires so much intense attention to the specific details of nature right like there comes some kinds of fishing like i i fished my whole life there's some kinds of fishing where you just cast something out you don't need to look you don't need to pay attention you reel you reel on and you're sometimes you get something some you don't you just you're blank

C. Thi Nguyen: 让飞蝇钓对我而言成为一项运动的部分原因在于，它需要你对大自然的具体细节投入极其强烈的关注，对吧？有些钓鱼方式——我钓了一辈子的鱼——在某些钓鱼方式里，你只需要把鱼线抛出去，你不需要看，不需要注意，你就是摇卷线器，有时候能钓到，有时候钓不到，你的大脑是空白的。

[00:06:31]

C. Thi Nguyen: fly fishing the kind of fly fishing i like dryfly fishing where you try to trick a trout into taking a floating imitation insect off of the top of the water the way that's done in its like extreme and purest form is that you have to like quietly walk down the river searching the surface of the water first you look for the subtle details of the water that indicate to you that there might be some like a holding spot some soft slower water

C. Thi Nguyen: 但飞蝇钓，尤其是那种我喜欢的干蝇钓法 (dry-fly fishing)，你要试图骗过一条鳟鱼，让它去咬水面上漂浮的仿生昆虫。把它做到极致和最纯粹的形式是：你必须安静地沿着河流走，首先搜索水面，寻找水流微妙的细节，这些细节能向你暗示那里可能有一个藏鱼点，一些流速较缓的平缓水域。

[00:06:56]

C. Thi Nguyen: and then you have to look and see you actually if you're lucky and if you're attentive enough you can see the trout like kind of come up and sip other insects off the surface of the of the water and then you have to cast delicately this tiny little insect this fake insect to land in front of the trout and it and if you get it all right you get like the most glorious experience of a trout swimming up like seeing your fly kind of inspecting it and then like deciding to go for it hopefully

C. Thi Nguyen: 然后你必须仔细看。如果你运气好且足够专注，你可以看到鳟鱼游上来，从水面上吸食其他昆虫。接着，你必须极其精细地把你这只微小的假昆虫抛落在鳟鱼的面前。如果你一切都做对了，你就会获得最辉煌的体验：一条鳟鱼游上来，看到了你的假饵，似乎在检查它，然后决定一口咬下去，希望如此。

[00:07:30]

C. Thi Nguyen: it's clear that catching fish is not actually the point because we let the fish go right like almost all fly fishers are catch and release fishers the the point is that in order to do this you have to cultivate this incredibly intense form of attention you have to stare at the surface of the water and the experience i have fly fishing is basically like it cleans out my soul more than anything else i can think of

C. Thi Nguyen: 很明显，捕鱼并不是真正的目的，因为我们会把鱼放走，几乎所有的飞蝇钓者都是“钓获放流”的。真正的目的在于，为了做到这一点，你必须培养一种极其强烈的注意力，你必须死死盯着水面。飞蝇钓给我的体验，基本上比我能想到的任何其他事物都更能净化我的灵魂。

[00:07:56]

C. Thi Nguyen: and the main reason is that there's nothing else i do that is anything like fly fishing where you go to a river and you stare with absolute attention at the surface of moving water for like a day and i'm i mean and this i think one of the reason it works for me is some people are natural meditators i am not i'm like a total hyper weirdo and if you taken me to a river and you're like look at that river and clear your mind i would last like 30 seconds and then i would like get bored

C. Thi Nguyen: 主要原因是我做的其他任何事情都不像飞蝇钓那样：你去到河边，用绝对的注意力盯着流动的水面看上一整天。我认为这对我有效的原因之一是，有些人是天生的冥想者，但我不是，我完全是个过度亢奋的怪人。如果你把我带到河边，跟我说：“看着那条河，清空你的大脑”，我大概只能撑30秒，然后就会觉得无聊。

[00:08:27]

C. Thi Nguyen: but if you give me a game if you give me a target if you're like try to catch fish if you give me this goal and puzzle suddenly that kind of transforms my entire spirit like the way i attend the world and it kind of guides my attention

C. Thi Nguyen: 但如果你给我一个游戏，给我一个目标，比如“去试着抓鱼”，如果你给我这个目标和谜题，它就会突然改变我整个人的精神状态，改变我关注世界的方式，它引导了我的注意力。

[00:08:45]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i think this is like this is the really interesting thing about games and this is an interesting thing about games and play so i think play as i understand it like it's anything you do for its own sake it's anything where you do where the process the doing the activity is the important part and not the outcome

C. Thi Nguyen: 我觉得这就是游戏真正有趣的地方，这也是游戏和“游玩 (play)”的有趣之处。所以在我看来，“游玩”就是任何你为了事物本身而做的事情，任何过程中“做”和“行动”才是最重要的部分，而不是结果的活动。

[00:09:03]

C. Thi Nguyen: by the way this is this is something that's really important suits notes that not all games are play right like if you got good at poker and you hate poker but it's the only way for you to make money now and support your family you're playing a game but it's not really play it's work right

C. Thi Nguyen: 顺便说一句，有一点非常重要，Suits 注意到并非所有的游戏都是“游玩”，对吧？比如，如果你很擅长扑克，但你讨厌扑克，可它现在是你赚钱养家的唯一途径，那你是在玩一个游戏，但这已经不是纯粹的“游玩”了，那是工作，对吧？

[00:09:20]

Sean: is that what you call achievement play

Sean: 这就是你所说的“成就型游玩 (achievement play)”吗？

[00:09:22]

C. Thi Nguyen: so achievement play is play uh is play for the point of winning right the goal of achievement play is to win it's only valuable if you win striving play is play where you play for the sake of the process for the sake of the struggle and you don't galactically care if you win

C. Thi Nguyen: 成就型游玩是指为了赢而玩，对吧？成就型游玩的目标就是获胜，只有赢了它才有价值。而“奋斗型游玩 (striving play)”则是指为了过程、为了挣扎的体验而玩，你在宏观层面上根本不在乎你是否获胜。

[00:09:43]

C. Thi Nguyen: but for striving play trying to win you have to try to win in order to experience that that that absorption right this is the thing i was talking about fly fishing for me fly fishing is driving play the thing i want is absorption the thing i want is to be lost in the river and to have my mind like poured out of my ego and like sent somewhere else but i can't do that without a goal right i have to try intensely to catch a fish to have that experience of absorption

C. Thi Nguyen: 但在奋斗型游玩中，你必须去“努力”获胜，为了体验那种专注感，你必须要去争取胜利，对吧？这就是我刚才谈论飞蝇钓时说的。对我来说，飞蝇钓就是奋斗型游玩。我想要的是专注，我想要的是迷失在河水中，让我的思维从自我中倾倒出来，被送到某个别的地方。但如果没有一个目标，我是做不到这一点的，对吧？我必须非常努力地去抓一条鱼，才能获得那种极致专注的体验。

### 第三章：规则与自由的悖论 (00:10:15 - 00:15:00)

[00:10:15]

Sean: so the paradox of games is that they are governed by rules and structure and scoring systems and yet they do create this space for freedom and play why is that is that as paradoxical as it seems

Sean: 所以游戏的悖论在于：它们是由规则、结构和计分系统所支配的，然而它们却创造出了一个享受自由和游玩的空间。为什么会这样？这真的像看起来那么自相矛盾吗？

[00:10:30]

C. Thi Nguyen: yeah this is there are like so many levels to this paradox you know one thing you can do at the climbing gym is they set specific problems and to do the problem you have to do all the holes are of the same color that's the problem the gym set for you or you can just kind of do whatever and just wander all over the holes and go anywhere you want

C. Thi Nguyen: 是的。这个悖论有很多层含义。你知道，在攀岩馆里你可以做的一件事是，他们会设定特定的路线难题。为了完成这个难题，你必须只能抓相同颜色的岩点，这是攀岩馆为你设定的难题。或者你也可以随心所欲，在所有岩点上乱爬，想去哪去哪。

[00:10:57]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i was like a really clumsy human being who had like no sense of where my hips were and it i only like was forced to find like a refinement in hip motion and a refinement in subtle body balance when i climbed a specific hard problem especially because some problems had been set to like kind of force you to like inch your way over like with your hips only like a millimeter away from the wall and it's like that kind of constraint that pushes you to find something new

C. Thi Nguyen: 我曾经是一个极其笨拙的人，根本感觉不到自己的臀部位置在哪里。只有当我攀爬一条特定的困难路线时，我才被迫去找到臀部运动的精准感和微妙的身体平衡感。特别是因为某些难题被设定成这样：迫使你一点一点挪动过去，让你的臀部离墙壁只有一毫米的距离。正是这种限制，推动着你去发现新的东西。

[00:11:34]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i think games kind of do something similar right if you have a lot of games each game pushes you into a new kind of like rock climbing pushes me to an intention to attention and delicacy like chess pushes me into like hyper forward thinking like clear logic or like you know right now uh my i've just been learning um a weird new skill toy kandama which is the japanese like ball and cup game

C. Thi Nguyen: 我认为游戏也在做类似的事情。如果你有很多游戏，每一款游戏都会把你推向一种新的状态。就像攀岩把我推向了极度的专注和微妙的控制；国际象棋把我推向了极其超前的前瞻性思考和清晰的逻辑。再比如现在，我刚在学一个奇怪的新技巧玩具“剑玉” (Kendama)，就是日本那种把球抛进杯子里的游戏。

[00:12:04]

C. Thi Nguyen: with where you have to like precise control where this ball is going and suddenly you're learning how much you can control momentum by like knee motion and dropping with things to like give yourself it's you can you learn that you can control your frame of reference in relation to a moving ball by dropping yourself up and down and these are never things i would have found except that some weirdass restriction pushed me there

C. Thi Nguyen: 在那里，你必须精确控制这个球的走向。突然之间你开始学习到，你能够通过膝盖的运动和下蹲来控制多少动量。你会学到，通过身体的上下起伏，你可以控制你相对于运动球体的参照系。如果不是被某种怪异的限制逼到那个地步，这些是我永远都无法发现的。

[00:12:33]

Sean: well the thing about those games like like chess or whatever is they also narrow your focus i think intuitively we think of freedom in negative terms right it's the absence of control the absence of rules the absence of constraints um and obviously that's not the case in games and there is this weird way um that it's like not true in life either

Sean: 像国际象棋这类的游戏，它们也会收窄你的注意力。我想直觉上我们倾向于用消极的角度来思考“自由”，对吧？认为自由就是没有控制，没有规则，没有限制。很明显在游戏里不是这样。而且奇怪的是，在生活中似乎也不是这样。

[00:12:54]

Sean: i mean you hear this kind of thing a lot in like uh military culture that discipline is freedom that true liberation is being fully committed to a certain structure a certain system because you're not paralyzed by constantly figuring out who you are what your purpose is you have an identity you know what you value you know what you're supposed to do and you just you just get up and do it um does that like way of thinking make sense to you

Sean: 我的意思是，你在军事文化里经常听到这种说法：“纪律即自由”。真正的解放是完全致力于某种结构、某种体系，因为你不会被“不断弄清楚你是谁、你的目的是什么”这种想法所麻痹。你有了一个身份，你知道你重视什么，你知道你该做什么，你只要站起来去做就行了。这种思维方式对你来说合理吗？

[00:13:19]

C. Thi Nguyen: absolutely 100% there is a deep resonance here with the idea that's as old as russo i think maybe even older that what governments do is they create new rights via restrictions right you create you create a right to property by restricting people from taking stuff you create like other kinds of right rights by restricting people from like attacking each other in public

C. Thi Nguyen: 绝对，百分之百合理。这与一种至少可以追溯到卢梭（甚至更早）的思想产生了深深的共鸣：政府的作用就是通过限制来创造新的权利，对吧？你通过限制人们抢夺东西来创造了财产权；你通过限制人们在公共场合互相攻击，创造了其他种类的权利。

[00:13:48]

C. Thi Nguyen: i think there's actually one of maybe this will help uh when i was starting this whole project and i was thinking about games i uh i was i was reading all the stuff that was making me really angry that was trying to understand games as an art form by thinking about movies and narrative and i mean they do that stuff too but i was really interested in how the rules shaped us

C. Thi Nguyen: 我觉得这里还有一点，也许会有所帮助。当我开始这个项目并思考游戏时，我读了所有那些让我非常生气的东西——那些试图通过电影和叙事来将游戏理解为一种艺术形式的文章。我的意思是，游戏确实包含这些元素，但我真正感兴趣的是：规则是如何塑造我们的？

[00:14:05]

C. Thi Nguyen: and my first thought was that if you think of games as like free form rule systems made for delight then what they are is like art government does that make sense like they're like playing with what we do for governance

C. Thi Nguyen: 我的第一个想法是：如果你把游戏看作是为了带来愉悦而创建的自由形式的规则系统，那么它们就像是“艺术化的政府管理”。这说得通吗？就像它们在把玩我们在治理国家时所做的事情。

[00:14:20]

C. Thi Nguyen: so john dewey the philosopher john dewey says that every art form takes some normal human activity and like refineses it and hyperconentrates it and games do two things is they hyperconentrate like activity and choice and skill and decision and they do it by taking the structure of governments and contracts and rule systems and instead of using them for like desperate moral purposes they like break them free and create weirdass forms of life where you're suddenly like i don't know playing a storytelling game and the rules tell you you have to make up like screwed up backstory in in order to like get your stamina back and now you're forced to do this thing cuz the game has like freed you into a new area

C. Thi Nguyen: 哲学家约翰·杜威 (John Dewey) 说过，每一种艺术形式都会截取某种正常的人类活动，将其提炼并高度浓缩。而游戏做了两件事：它们高度浓缩了我们的行动、选择、技能和决策；而它们做到这一点的方式，是借用了政府、合同和规则系统的结构。它们不把这些结构用于严肃绝望的道德目的，而是将它们释放出来，创造出怪异的生活形式。突然之间，你可能在玩一个讲故事的游戏，规则告诉你必须编造一个非常糟糕的背景故事才能恢复你的体力。现在你被迫去做这件事，因为游戏已经把你“释放”到了一个全新的领域。

### 第四章：现实生活“游戏化”的道德危险 (00:15:00 - 00:24:28)

[00:15:00]

Sean: so why is it then that when we impose scoring systems on everyday life socially professionally personally they often maybe not always but often have the opposite effect that they do in games why why do we lose autonomy when we do this

Sean: 那么，为什么当我们在日常生活、社交、职场或个人生活中强加计分系统时，它们通常（也许不总是，但通常）会产生与游戏中相反的效果？为什么我们在这样做时会失去自主权？

[00:15:33]

C. Thi Nguyen: there are there this to me is the most interesting question and there's so many levels to answer this on one answer is that games are designed for fun and pleasure and joy a lot of the times and institutional scoring systems are designed for something else typically something like optimizing productivity or maybe at best accountability but they sure as hell aren't designed for fun or freedom

C. Thi Nguyen: 对我来说，这是最有趣的问题，回答这个问题有很多个层面。一个答案是，游戏通常是为乐趣、愉悦和喜悦而设计的；而机构的计分系统则是为了其他目的设计的，通常是为了优化生产力，或者充其量是为了问责，但它们绝对不是为了乐趣或自由而设计的。

[00:15:57]

C. Thi Nguyen: the next answer is that not only are games typically designed for fun and joy you have free range over games you can move between games you have choice over games and you rarely have choice over the scoring systems that are found in institutions

C. Thi Nguyen: 下一个答案是，不仅游戏通常是为乐趣和喜悦设计的，你对游戏还有自由的选择权。你可以在不同的游戏之间切换，你可以选择玩什么游戏，但你很少有权选择机构和体制中存在的那些计分系统。

[00:16:12]

C. Thi Nguyen: a crucial thing about games is the point systems are detached from ordinary life in most cases again not all the time but a lot of the times it just doesn't matter how many points you got and it doesn't matter whether you won or not the goal of play and the purpose of play are different

C. Thi Nguyen: 关于游戏，至关重要的一点是，在大多数情况下（同样不是所有时候），它的积分系统与普通生活是脱节的。很多时候，你得了多少分并不重要，你赢了没有也不重要。游玩的目标（goal，即赢得游戏）和目的（purpose，即为了乐趣）是不同的。

[00:16:43]

C. Thi Nguyen: when my spouse and i pick up a board game and we try to kill each other the reason that's possible is because goals and purposes are different right my purpose for playing with my spouse is to have an interesting lovely excellent time my goal is to win

C. Thi Nguyen: 当我的配偶和我拿起一个棋盘游戏，我们试图“干掉”彼此时，这之所以成为可能，是因为目标和目的是不同的，对吧？我和配偶玩的“目的”是度过一段有趣、美好、卓越的时光；而我的“目标”是赢。

[00:16:59]

C. Thi Nguyen: and the reason i can have this special experience of going all out of completely trying to like destroy her position and take everything apart is because winning in the game doesn't matter right there's nothing that's actually tied to her long-term well-being about whether she loses or wins or whether i lose or win

C. Thi Nguyen: 我之所以能有这种“全力以赴、试图完全摧毁她的阵地、把一切都拆解”的特殊体验，是因为在游戏中获胜并不重要，对吧？她输还是赢，我输还是赢，实际上与她长期的幸福没有任何关系。

[00:17:13]

C. Thi Nguyen: and that's completely different when scoring systems are tied to your grades your resume your earnings your income the freedom we have to just go all out in this kind of secluded environment only happens only we only get it when uh the meanings are detached from ordinary life and that's that's not not that's not something that happens with institutional metrics

C. Thi Nguyen: 但当计分系统与你的成绩、你的简历、你的收入、你的薪水挂钩时，情况就完全不同了。我们在这种封闭环境里可以全力以赴的自由，只有当它的意义与普通生活脱节时才会发生。而这种脱节，在机构的指标体系中是不会发生的。

[00:17:42]

Sean: but games are also these like bounded little worlds right i mean the purpose of a score is to tell you who's winning and who's losing and that works in a game because games are these domains with fixed rules and and standardized or universal goals but can we treat life that way without stripping it of everything that makes it interesting and diverse and worth living

Sean: 但游戏也是这种有边界的小世界，对吧？我的意思是，分数的目的是告诉你谁赢谁输，这在游戏中行得通，因为游戏是具有固定规则和标准化或普遍目标的领域。但是，我们能用这种方式对待生活，而不剥夺那些让生活变得有趣、多样和值得过的一切吗？

[00:18:00]

C. Thi Nguyen: there's a way in which treating life like a game is everything important and the path to like a full rich meaningful life and there's a way in which treating life like a game is a moral disaster and they're different

C. Thi Nguyen: 有一种把生活当成游戏的方式是至关重要的，也是通向充实、丰富、有意义生活的途径；但还有另一种把生活当成游戏的方式，那却是一场道德灾难。这两种方式是完全不同的。

[00:18:20]

Sean: okay say more so

Sean: 好的，请多讲讲。

[00:18:33]

C. Thi Nguyen: the way to treat life like a game that's valuable is to reflect on whether the activities and the scoring systems that you're engaged in are actually meaningful and rich

C. Thi Nguyen: 把生活当成游戏并能产生价值的方式，是去反思你所参与的活动和计分系统是否真的有意义、是否丰富。

[00:18:40]

C. Thi Nguyen: mhm i mean if there's anything we can learn from like true play it's that we have a huge amount of choice about the nature of the activity the nature of the struggle and and the richness we find from it i mean the magic of games is that you don't have to play any particular game

C. Thi Nguyen: 嗯，我的意思是，如果我们能从真正的游玩中学到什么，那就是我们对活动的本质、挣扎的本质以及我们从中发现的丰富性，有着巨大的选择权。游戏的魔力在于你不必非得玩任何特定的游戏。

[00:18:57]

C. Thi Nguyen: i mean the magic of games in in in the best ideal circumstance there are plenty of cases where someone might be forced to play a terrible game but in the ideal circumstance you can try marathon running i tried marathon running i hate it it sucks it makes me miserable um and then i tried rock climbing

C. Thi Nguyen: 我的意思是，在最理想的情况下，游戏的魔力就在于此。虽然有很多情况下人们可能会被迫玩一个糟糕的游戏，但在理想情况下，你可以尝试跑马拉松。我试过跑马拉松，我讨厌它，它糟透了，让我很痛苦。然后我尝试了攀岩。

[00:19:14]

C. Thi Nguyen: and you can like change the game that you're playing like i used to try to climb the most difficult climb in rock climbing now i try to climb as i get older and have realized i'm never going to be that strong i try to find elegant climbs and max out how elegantly i'm climbing them right you can you can modify you can switch you can dance between games

C. Thi Nguyen: 你可以改变你正在玩的游戏。比如我以前总是试图在攀岩中挑战最难的路线。现在随着年龄增长，我意识到我永远不会那么强壮了，所以我试图寻找优雅的攀岩路线，并将我攀爬的优雅度发挥到极致。对吧，你可以修改，你可以切换，你可以在不同的游戏之间跳舞。

[00:19:29]

C. Thi Nguyen: and like i think the right spirit of gaming that is like a gateway to the right spirit of life is stepping back from particular systems and scoring systems and constraints and rules and asking if they actually work for you and not being content if they're not working for you that's that's the hopeful spirit

C. Thi Nguyen: 我认为正确的游戏精神——这就像是通往正确生活精神的大门——是退后一步，跳出特定的系统、计分系统、限制和规则，问问它们对你来说是否真的有效。如果它们对你无效，就不要去满足于此。这是一种充满希望的精神。

[00:19:52]

C. Thi Nguyen: the bad spirit is i don't know having a billion dollar company and trying to max out its profits no matter what and not caring if that destroys every other life yeah or like other people's well-being or way of life

C. Thi Nguyen: 而糟糕的精神是……我不知道，比如拥有一家估值十亿美元的公司，然后无论如何都要试图使其利润最大化，而不在乎这是否会毁掉其他所有的生命，或者别人的幸福和生活方式。

[00:20:12]

C. Thi Nguyen: because that is a i mean the first way of doing it i mean deeply respects the boundedness of games and the fact that there these little detached systems we can dive into or out of

C. Thi Nguyen: 因为，第一种做法深深地尊重了游戏的边界性，尊重它们是我们可以随时投入或退出的一个个小型的、脱离现实的系统。

[00:20:24]

C. Thi Nguyen: and the thing the other thing i'm talking about um is when you take a real world system that is connected to everything that is connected to people's well-being that is connected to i don't know the financial security of the world and then you treat that like a game and you try to go all out to destroy people um but you're not doing it under a temporary disposable scoring system that you're just going to throw away at the end of the night you're doing it for real resources

C. Thi Nguyen: 而我说的另一种糟糕的情况是，当你拿一个与一切相连、与人们的幸福相连、与世界的金融安全相连的真实世界系统，然后你把它当作游戏来对待，你试图全力以赴去摧毁别人……但你这么做的时候，所处的并不是一个临时的、一次性的、可以在今晚结束时就扔掉的计分系统，你是在为了真实的资源这么做。

### 第五章：“价值俘获”——指标如何悄然重塑我们的灵魂 (00:24:28 - 00:30:05)

[00:24:28]

Sean: there's a phrase in the book that um i think is really important and the phrase is value capture um i i could you talk about how the values of scores and metrics in life quietly shape and reshape what we actually desire

Sean: 书中有一个短语，我认为非常重要，这个短语叫做“价值俘获 (value capture)”。你能谈谈生活中的分数和指标，是如何悄无声息地塑造和重塑我们内心真正渴望的东西的吗？

[00:24:52]

C. Thi Nguyen: when i was writing my first book about games a lot of people were like "oh you love games so you must love gamification you must love the gamification of work and education." and my first response was like if you actually understand what makes games special and distinctive you will hate the gamification of grades and education and work and communication on social media

C. Thi Nguyen: 当我写第一本关于游戏的书时，很多人会说：“哦，你喜欢游戏，那你肯定喜欢游戏化，你肯定喜欢工作和教育的游戏化。” 我的第一反应是：如果你真正理解是什么让游戏变得特别和与众不同，你就会厌恶分数、教育、工作以及社交媒体沟通被游戏化。

[00:25:05]

C. Thi Nguyen: and in trying to express this i started using this term value capture so value capture is the idea that sometimes your values are rich or subtle or dynamic or plural or developing that way and then you get parked in an institution or a social setting that feeds you simplified typically quantified versions of those values and then the simplified quantified version takes over

C. Thi Nguyen: 在试图表达这一点时，我开始使用“价值俘获”这个词。价值俘获的理念是：有时候，你的价值观是丰富的、微妙的、动态的、多元的，或者正在朝着这个方向发展；然后，你被置于某个机构或社会环境中，它喂给你这些价值观的简化版本、通常是量化的版本。接着，这个简化的量化版本就会反客为主，接管一切。

[00:25:37]

C. Thi Nguyen: like going to school out of a love of ideas and coming out focused on your grades uh going to journalism focused on i don't know newsworthiness or communication or explanation and then coming out like obsessed with your retweet numbers or follower counts or page views or subscriber counts or starting some health practice hoping to be healthier and happier and then coming out obsessed with your step counts or your bmi or your weight right in each of these cases there's this shift

C. Thi Nguyen: 比如，出于对思想的热爱去上学，毕业时却只关注自己的GPA；投身新闻业，原本关注的是新闻的价值、沟通或解释世界，出来时却沉迷于推特的转发数、粉丝数、浏览量或订阅数；或者开始某种健康习惯，希望能变得更健康、更快乐，结果却变得痴迷于步数、BMI 指数或体重指标。对吧，在所有这些情况中，都发生了这种转变。

[00:26:08]

C. Thi Nguyen: um and i'm really interested in that shift it's a shift between this kind of this rich subtle often changing way of valuing and then the narrowness and thinness of metrics and i've been thinking about this about why this is bad

C. Thi Nguyen: 我对这种转变非常感兴趣。这是从那种丰富的、微妙的、经常变化的价值衡量方式，向狭隘且单薄的“指标”转变的过程。我一直在思考，为什么这是一件坏事。

[00:26:25]

C. Thi Nguyen: um the first thing i thought was something like and i think this is what a lot of people think that like oh the problem with this is that from the outside you're not autonomous you're not free you don't get to choose and i don't think that's quite right because a lot of the gamifications are ones that people choose right people choose to put on a fitbit people choose to go on a social media platform and uh orient themselves towards likes

C. Thi Nguyen: 我首先想到的是，也是我认为很多人都会想到的：哦，这样做的问题在于，从外部来看你不再自主了，你不再自由了，你没有选择权了。但我认为这不完全正确。因为很多“游戏化”恰恰是人们自己选择的，对吧？人们选择戴上 Fitbit 手环，人们选择注册社交媒体平台，并将自己的目标定位在追求“点赞”上。

[00:26:48]

C. Thi Nguyen: i think what's really important is not the issue of choice always but the nature of the values that we find in metrics i think they're like thinner and they're emptier the way i put it i've been putting it is that the most important thing to think about here is the gap the gap between what's really important and what's easy to measure institutionally

C. Thi Nguyen: 我认为真正重要的并不总是“选择权”的问题，而是我们在指标中发现的价值观的本质。我认为它们更单薄，也更空洞。我一直以来的表述是，这里最需要思考的是那种“差距 (gap)”——在真正重要的东西与机构层面容易衡量的东西之间的差距。

[00:27:17]

C. Thi Nguyen: so i think to really understand the harm of value capture what it's really doing for us we have to ask another question a question about the nature of metrics the nature of data the nature of institutions and what happens when we tie our values to large scale institutional scoring systems

C. Thi Nguyen: 所以我认为，要真正理解“价值俘获”的危害以及它对我们的实际影响，我们必须问另一个问题：关于指标的本质、数据的本质、机构的本质，以及当我们将自己的价值观与大规模机构计分系统绑定时，究竟会发生什么。

[00:27:30]

C. Thi Nguyen: because scoring systems i mean i kind of think they're like the hidden the hidden mover of the modern world like what's happening in the modern world is that we humans are becoming reoriented to care not about what matters to us uh and what we find is important to us but we're oriented towards things that are easy to coordinate on in large scale mass bureaucracies

C. Thi Nguyen: 因为计分系统，我的意思是，我有点觉得它们就像是现代世界隐藏的驱动力。在现代世界中正在发生的事情是，我们人类正在被重新定位。我们关心的不再是对我们有意义的、我们自己认为重要的东西；相反，我们开始倾向于那些在大型官僚机构中很容易被协调和统筹的东西。

[00:28:00]

Sean: 100% and i mean i think you say this somewhere in the book um which seems obvious um but you just don't really think about it that you know any any scoring system communicates a goal and whenever we consent to judge ourselves by a metric or number we're also conceding that that's the goal that that's the whole point of doing the thing we're doing

Sean: 百分之百同意。我想你在书里的某个地方说过这个——这似乎显而易见，但你平时就是不会去想它——那就是，任何计分系统都在传达一个目标。当我们同意用一个指标或数字来评判自己时，我们也就妥协了，承认那就是我们的目标，承认那就是我们做这件事情的全部意义。

[00:28:20]

Sean: and it's not hard to see how that can go wrong in your life if you start playing these games without asking yourself if those are actually your goals right you know like you mentioned like so i'm a journalist and uh i used to write pieces all the time now i do this show and in both cases people are judging me by page views by clicks by the download numbers and i hate it

Sean: 不难看出，如果你开始玩这些游戏，却不问自己那些是否真的是你的目标，这在你的生活中会如何走向歧途。就像你提到的，比如我是一名记者，我以前经常写文章，现在我做这个播客。在这两种情况下，人们都在用页面浏览量、点击量、下载量来评判我，我恨透了这点。

[00:28:47]

Sean: but i'd be lying if i pretended that all these metrics didn't slowly shape how i come to value the work and the work i do or don't do and i would i am sure that we are all dealing with our professional versions of this but it it's just a it's just a very concrete example for me how this has in fact uh how this has impacted my life

Sean: 但如果我假装所有这些指标没有慢慢地塑造我看待这份工作的方式，以及我决定做什么或不做什么，那我就是在撒谎。我确信我们所有人都在应对各自职业领域中这种现象的变体，但这对我来说只是一个非常具体的例子，说明了这实际上是如何影响了我的生活。

[00:29:10]

Sean: um and it's not like i was oblivious to it but i think reading the book made me really sort of wrestle with it and it's and then you can start seeing this play out in other uh domains of life too and it's it's um it's everywhere it's everywhere it's value outsourcing

Sean: 并不是说我对它一无所知，但我认为读这本书让我真正开始去与它抗争。然后你就能开始看到它在生活的其他领域也上演着。它无处不在，这就是“价值观外包 (value outsourcing)”。

[00:29:30]

C. Thi Nguyen: yes right and i think it's really important to remember that we outsource all the time and we outsource value it's really like yeah you have to right like you outsource like i outsource my values about dishwashers all the time right i just like buy a dishwasher and i just don't think about it like it's not that important to me someone else has made the decisions about what matters in a in a dishwasher

C. Thi Nguyen: 是的，没错。我认为要记住我们一直在进行外包，我们在外包价值观，这一点非常重要。这就像，是的，你必须这样做，对吧？就像你外包一样，我也经常把我关于洗碗机的价值观外包出去，对吧？我就去买个洗碗机，然后不再去想它，因为它对我来说没那么重要。关于洗碗机什么最重要，别人已经替我做了决定。

[00:29:57]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i think what's really important is that it makes sense to outsource valuing and valource decisions the further it is from the center of your life and soul but the closer you are to like what really matters to you and what makes you you the yeah the more self-destroying and soul destroying it is to outsource your values

C. Thi Nguyen: 我认为真正重要的是：外包你的价值评估和决策，这件事离你的生活和灵魂中心越远，就越说得通。但是，它离对你真正重要的东西、离塑造“你之所以为你”的核心越近，外包你的价值观就越具有自我毁灭性和摧残灵魂的破坏力。

### 第五章（续）：“价值俘获”与如何在游戏中保持清醒 (00:30:05 - 00:34:00)

[00:30:15]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i think part of what's going on with a lot of metrics is that they're pre-fabricated value systems it's really easy you can just grab them right just like look i don't want to do the research about my dishwasher i'm just going to look at some online review and take number one

C. Thi Nguyen: 我认为很多指标的问题在于，它们是“预制好的价值系统”。这太容易了，你直接拿来用就行，对吧？就像：听着，我不想去对洗碗机做研究，我只想看看网上测评然后买个排名第一的。

[00:30:31]

C. Thi Nguyen: if you do the same thing about the idea of what makes your podcast good the idea of like what makes your work good what makes your education good the idea of what makes your life good then you are letting i mean i literally think what you're doing like if you outsource your your say your sense of what makes a good communication if you tie that to how many likes you get you're literally like outsourcing your values and your social values to mark zuckerberg

C. Thi Nguyen: 如果你对“什么是好的播客”、“什么是好的工作”、“什么是好的教育”甚至“什么是好的生活”也采取同样的做法，那你就是让……我的意思是，我真的认为你所做的，比如你把“什么是好的交流”的评判标准外包出去，如果你把它和获得了多少个赞挂钩，那你简直就是把你的价值观和社会价值外包给了马克·扎克伯格。

[00:31:07]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i mean it's even more than that cuz i think it's not just an external person the the most important thing about this value outsourcing is like other kinds of outsourcing what you're doing is you're onboarding and internalizing a system that's been made to work at mass scale right it's not like metrics will not measure the tiny little subtle details of your life

C. Thi Nguyen: 这还不止如此，因为我认为这不仅仅是外包给某个外部的人。这种“价值外包”最重要的一点是，就像其他种类的外包一样，你正在引入并内化一个为了在“大规模”层面上运作而建立的系统。你要知道，指标系统是不会去衡量你生活中那些微小、微妙的细节的。

[00:31:32]

Sean: do you think there's a way to play these games without also being played by them i mean i think we are all very good at fooling ourselves and i imagine many people will tell themselves that they can play all these social and professional games without compromising what they actually deep down value do you think that's mostly bullshit

Sean: 你觉得有办法在玩这些游戏的同时，不被它们给“玩”了吗？我的意思是，我们都很擅长自欺欺人，我想很多人会告诉自己：他们可以玩这些社交和职场的游戏，同时不损害他们内心深处真正珍视的东西。你觉得这大都是在扯淡吗？

[00:31:51]

C. Thi Nguyen: i mean it's it's possible it's hard i mean it's it's hard i wrote this damn book about it and it's still hard for me um it's possible i mean here's one way to put it right now you can't escape from the fact that metrics are tied to incentives you can't escape from the fact that metrics are tied to money power and influence

C. Thi Nguyen: 我的意思是，这是有可能的，但很难。真的很难，我写了这本关于它的书，但对我来说依然很难。它是可能的。这么说吧，现在你无法逃避一个事实：指标与激励机制是挂钩的，你无法逃避指标与金钱、权力和影响力挂钩的现实。

[00:32:11]

C. Thi Nguyen: but it's one thing to know that a metric will give you more power and more influence and it's another thing to take it inside yourself and um take it on as your central value because if you just know that it's a resource then you can trade off you can decide like look one one way you could i mean you should tell me how this plays out for you

C. Thi Nguyen: 但知道“某个指标能给你带来更多权力和影响力”是一回事，而“把它内化到你自己心里，把它当作你的核心价值”则是另一回事。因为如果你仅仅把它看作是一种资源，那你就可以进行权衡取舍。你可以决定……比如你可以这么做，其实你应该告诉我这对你来说是怎么样的。

[00:32:39]

C. Thi Nguyen: but i what i would imagine if i were a big famous podcaster like you one way to do it would be to be like look here's what i want here's the message i want to communicate here's how i care about it in order to get it across i need good subscriber counts but if i get a huge subscriber count by compromising my values on journalism and communication then that'll be worthless

C. Thi Nguyen: 但我想象一下，如果我是像你一样有名的大播客，一种做法是：“看，这是我想要的，这是我想传达的信息，这就是我在乎它的方式。为了把它传达出去，我需要好的订阅量。但是，如果我是通过妥协我对于新闻和沟通的价值观来获得巨大的订阅量，那这就一文不值了。”

[00:33:08]

C. Thi Nguyen: so in that case you'd be maxim you'd be trying to increase your subscriber count as an instrument to achieving some other value you'd articulated yourself that'd be one way of being a non-captured way of being

C. Thi Nguyen: 所以在那种情况下，你试图增加订阅量，只是将它作为一种“工具”，来实现在你自己内心早已明确阐述的其他价值。那将是一种没有被（系统）俘获的生存方式。

[00:33:15]

C. Thi Nguyen: another way of being would be like being like "okay i'm just here's the goal maximum subscriber counts do whatever it takes right?" and then you would never trade off you would just do whatever it takes

C. Thi Nguyen: 而另一种生存方式则是：“好的，现在的目标就是订阅量最大化，不择手段，对吧？”如果是这样，你就永远不会去权衡取舍，你只会为了目标不择手段。

[00:33:27]

C. Thi Nguyen: and i i think the the key is i mean we can't rewrite the world so that there there no metrics and no incentives tied to metrics but at least we can like keep them outside of our central valuing system and keep them at arms length and know that they are only like very rough measures that kind of that will that will give us resources but not let them actually like determine what the thing we're trying to do is and what we're collecting resources for

C. Thi Nguyen: 所以我认为关键是，我们无法重写这个世界，无法让世界里没有指标或者没有与指标挂钩的激励。但至少我们可以让它们远离我们核心的价值系统，与它们保持一臂之距。要知道，它们只是一种非常粗糙的衡量标准，能给我们提供资源，但不要让它们实际决定“我们究竟想要做什么”，以及“我们到底是为了什么在收集资源”。

### 第六章：我们为何对指标上瘾？（清晰度与可移植性） (00:34:00 - 00:38:22)

[00:34:04]

Sean: institutions as you say we we love the scores and and they love the metrics because even though they're they're they're clean proxies for things we think we give a shit about right they they they they make our air quote values visible um why do we find that visibility so comforting i mean is it just about efficiency and control or is there something deeper going on here some uh craving for clarity or simplicity or whatever and and these are these these numbers give us the illusion of that

Sean: 就像你说的机构，我们喜欢分数，它们喜欢指标。因为尽管它们只是那些我们自认为在乎的事情的“干净替代品”，但它们让我们的“价值观”（加引号）变得可见了。为什么我们觉得这种可见性如此令人欣慰？我的意思是，这仅仅是因为效率和控制吗，还是有更深层的原因？比如对清晰或简单的渴望，而这些数字给了我们这种错觉？

[00:34:35]

C. Thi Nguyen: the pleasure of games is having an experience of value clarity right in normal life if you actually like let yourself be exposed to the rich complexity of life you have all these like brutally complicated decisions to make right like you're constantly trading off i'm constantly trading off between things that make me happy things that will make my kids happy things that will connect me to my friends things that will be good at for work things that will keep my body from falling apart

C. Thi Nguyen: 游戏的乐趣就在于它能给你带来“价值观无比清晰”的体验，对吧？在正常生活中，如果你真的让自己暴露在生活丰富的复杂性面前，你必须做所有这些极其残酷且复杂的决定，对吧？你总是在权衡取舍，我也总是在让我快乐的事、让我的孩子快乐的事、让我与朋友保持联系的事、对工作有好处的事，以及防止我身体垮掉的事之间做权衡。

[00:34:59]

C. Thi Nguyen: and like there's no clear way to make a decision that how do you measure the happiness of my child against you know the value of putting more time into a research effort that's a deep rich non-mechanical decision um and games make that easy right

C. Thi Nguyen: 根本没有一种清晰的方法来做决定。你该如何把“我孩子的幸福”和“投入更多时间做研究的价值”放在一起衡量呢？这是一个深奥的、丰富的、非机械性的决定。而游戏让这一切变得简单，对吧？

[00:35:23]

C. Thi Nguyen: like so if you're in a game for once you don't have to make these complicated trade-offs you know exactly what everything is worth you know exactly what gets you one point what gets you two points and what gets you three points the values are clear there are no questions about who won and one of the pleasures of value capture i think is that you you go on a a general universal standard of value right you're on like the gold standard like everyone can understand you you can understand everyone else it's easy to communicate like you all will agree instantly

C. Thi Nguyen: 比如在游戏里，你有史以来第一次不需要做这些复杂的权衡。你确切地知道每件事值多少，你确切地知道做什么得1分、什么得2分、什么得3分。价值是清晰的，对于谁赢了没有任何疑问。“价值俘获”的乐趣之一就是，你进入了一个普遍通用的价值标准，对吧？你就像处于“金本位”之上，每个人都能理解你，你也能理解所有人，沟通变得极其容易，大家会立刻达成共识。

[00:35:58]

C. Thi Nguyen: so the first thing is the sense of clarity but there's a second explanation um while i was researching this book i found this other book uh by theodore porter he's a historian the book is called trust in numbers and this book like rocked my world to the core

C. Thi Nguyen: 所以首先是因为这种“清晰感”。但还有第二个解释，我在为这本书做研究时，发现了另一本由历史学家西奥多·波特 (Theodore Porter) 写的书，书名叫《相信数字》(Trust in Numbers)。这本书从根本上震撼了我的世界观。

[00:36:15]

C. Thi Nguyen: so what he said was there are two ways of knowing about the world of understanding the world qualitative and quantitative and they're both good they're good at different things the problem comes when we reach compulsively for the quantitative um and we don't ever let ourselves balance these two ways of knowing

C. Thi Nguyen: 他在书里说，了解世界和理解世界有两种方式：定性的 (qualitative) 和定量的 (quantitative)。这两种方式都很好，它们擅长不同的事情。问题出在我们开始强迫性地追求定量方式，并且不再让自己去平衡这两种认知方式的时候。

[00:36:37]

C. Thi Nguyen: qualitative ways of knowing that is speaking thinking in words that way of knowing is very rich very contextsensitive uh very open-ended and dynamic but it travels badly between contexts because it requires a lot of shared background knowledge to understand

C. Thi Nguyen: 定性的认知方式，也就是用语言来表达和思考。这种认知方式非常丰富、对情境非常敏感，而且非常开放和动态。但它在不同情境之间的传播效果很差，因为理解它需要大量的共享背景知识。

[00:36:55]

C. Thi Nguyen: quantitative knowledge he says has been designed to travel the easiest example for me for my life is like grading so qualitative feedback is like what i give my students in like long written responses to their essays where i talk about their originality their rigor i respond to what they're trying to do i try to work with what they're thinking about i try to think about in multiple dimensions about their originality versus their openness i i can talk about all of this stuff

C. Thi Nguyen: 他说定量知识天生就是被设计成用来传播的。对我个人生活来说，最简单的例子就是评分。定性的反馈就像我在学生的论文上写下的长篇回复，我会谈论他们的原创性、他们的严谨性；我会回应他们试图表达的内容，我会顺着他们的思路去探讨，我会从多个维度去思考他们的原创性与开放性。我可以谈论所有这些东西。

[00:37:30]

C. Thi Nguyen: but that doesn't travel well outside of the specific context of philosophy like you know some employer in silicon valley is not going to care about this and more importantly it doesn't aggregate like you can't take the thousands of these that a student generates and push them into one number

C. Thi Nguyen: 但离开哲学的特定语境，这就传播不好了。比如，硅谷的某个雇主才不会关心这些。更重要的是，它无法被“汇总 (aggregate)”。你不能把一个学生产生的几千份这种评语压缩成一个数字。

[00:37:40]

C. Thi Nguyen: the way that we get aggregation is we make letter grade a is a four b is a three and we kind of hold that little slim meaning constant across the entire world of universities and high schools and employers so everyone vaguely knows what it means and then we can all connect collect and understand like a b means roughly the same thing and because it means roughly the same thing to everyone we've prepared the system then we get instant aggregation into gradeoint average

C. Thi Nguyen: 我们实现汇总的方式是使用字母评分法：A 是 4 分，B 是 3 分。我们把这个极其单薄的含义，在全世界所有的大学、高中和雇主之间保持恒定。所以每个人都大概知道它是什么意思。然后我们就可以收集、联系并理解：B 对大家来说意思差不多。因为它的意思都差不多，这个系统就准备就绪了，我们就可以立刻把它汇总成 GPA（平均成绩点数）。

[00:38:06]

C. Thi Nguyen: so one way to put it is that that portability is this incredibly powerful thing which has an enormous price where the price is sacrificing subtlety and context and that price is an intrinsic part of its powerful functionality

C. Thi Nguyen: 所以，可以这么说：这种“可移植性 (portability)”是一种极其强大的东西，但它伴随着巨大的代价——这个代价就是牺牲了微妙性与语境。而这个代价，正是其强大功能内在不可分割的一部分。

### 第七章：人生的终局与真实的意义 (00:42:15 - 00:49:23)

[00:42:15]

Sean: you end the book in a very nonbook way which is to which is to say you end it like a a good old-fashioned choose your own adventure game there's ending a and ending b uh one is a little sad and the other is a little hopeful um how would you sum up these two endings and which one do you really believe

Sean: 你的书以一种非常不像书的方式结尾，也就是说，你的结尾就像一款老派的“选择你的冒险”游戏。有结局 A 和结局 B，一个有点悲伤，另一个有点充满希望。你会怎么总结这两个结局？你到底相信哪一个？

[00:42:36]

C. Thi Nguyen: ending a the sad ending is about how originally we made all this shared language just to help us get what we really wanted to help us um to help us get what we actually cared about but we what we actually care about is really hard to express and what's re what's really easy for us to come up with language with and count and track is the tools the instruments the resources right it's easy to keep track of money and hard to keep track of your weirdass joy in playing with a yo-yo

C. Thi Nguyen: 结局 A，那个悲伤的结局是说：最初，我们创造了所有这些共同语言，只是为了帮助我们得到我们真正想要的东西，帮助我们得到我们在乎的东西。但我们真正关心的东西真的很难表达。反而那些真正容易让我们想出词汇去统计、去追踪的，是那些工具、手段和资源，对吧？追踪金钱很容易，但追踪你在玩溜溜球时那种怪异的喜悦却很难。

[00:43:12]

C. Thi Nguyen: and because it's so easy to track and communicate about the outcomes the tools the instruments the resources that can just track our attention until we forget internally and externally about the things that really mattered so the first ending is an ending about how the ease of communication makes us forget about happiness and joy and satisfaction

C. Thi Nguyen: 因为追踪并交流那些结果、工具、手段和资源实在是太容易了，这就会不断吸引我们的注意力，直到我们在内在和外在都忘记了那些真正重要的事情。所以，第一个结局讲述的是：那种极度便利的沟通方式，是如何让我们忘记了幸福、喜悦和满足感的。

[00:43:45]

Sean: i didn't think ending a was was all that sad i mean i could tell you why if you want... because i what i took you to be saying is that the things that make us us you know the things that make life rich and meaningful yeah we don't have precise language for these things i mean this this is the stuff of poetry not science you know we love these metrics because they're simple and they make everything intelligible and that's useful for sure but they can't capture the deeper stuff the shit that we really care about they don't capture the why um and that's kind of beautiful to me but i guess i guess the sad part is that um maybe we've we've internalized the idea that if something can't be systematically scored or measured then it's not real or it doesn't matter

Sean: 我其实觉得结局 A 没那么悲伤，如果你愿意，我可以告诉你为什么……因为我理解你的意思是指，那些塑造了“我们”的事物，那些让生活丰富而有意义的事物，我们对这些东西没有精确的语言。我的意思是，这是属于诗歌的领域，而不是科学的。你知道，我们喜欢这些指标是因为它们简单，它们让一切变得容易理解，这确实很有用；但它们无法捕捉到更深层的东西，也就是我们真正关心的那些破事，它们无法捕捉到“为什么”。这对我来说其实很美。但我想……我猜悲伤的部分在于，也许我们已经内化了这样一种观念：如果某件事不能被系统地评分或衡量，那么它就不真实，或者它就不重要。

[00:44:25]

C. Thi Nguyen: you're talking about the intermediary stage before we get to the sad stage the intermediary stage is when we rec is the one where we recognize that there are some things that are really easy to talk about that are familiar and there are other things that are weird and matter and that's what we have poetry for i mean lit like poetry and art is there for us to stab and point to what really matters when it's hard to count it together slowly like the fuzziness is crucial for pointing at things that matter but we don't have ready language for

C. Thi Nguyen: 你谈论的是在我们到达那个悲伤阶段之前的“中间阶段”。中间阶段是我们认识到，有些东西非常熟悉、很容易谈论；而另一些东西很怪异，但却很重要，这就是为什么我们需要诗歌。我的意思是，诗歌和艺术的存在，就是为了在难以被量化和统计的时候，去戳中并指向那些真正重要的事情。这种“模糊性”对于指向那些很重要但我们却没有现成语言来表达的事物来说，是至关重要的。

[00:45:05]

C. Thi Nguyen: that's the intermediate step the sad part is when the hyperclarity of easy to count metrics makes us forget about the value of poetry and what poetry counted for and then i don't know university systems start cutting out all humanities all art and all philosophy which is happening i mean my department's getting cut like our budget's getting slashed in favor of um in favor of ai programs um and then we don't encounter that stuff anymore i mean i'm worried that we're systematically socially shifting our attention away from poetry and the things that poetry points to towards the easily countable so that's that's why it's the sad end

C. Thi Nguyen: 那只是中间步骤。悲伤的部分在于：当那些易于统计的指标所带来的“超强清晰度”，使我们彻底忘记了诗歌的价值，忘记了诗歌本来是为了衡量什么的时候。然后，我不知道，大学系统就开始削减所有人文学科、所有的艺术和哲学——这正在发生。我的意思是，我的部门正在被削减，我们的预算被大幅削减，为了……为了让人工智能项目得到更多资金。然后，我们就再也接触不到这些东西了。我很担心我们在社会层面上系统性地将注意力从诗歌及其所指向的事物，转移到了那些容易计算的事物上。这就是为什么它是个悲惨的结局。

[00:45:48]

Sean: did i just hear you sigh horribly yeah when with the ai line that that's that's what you just described is like literally just like ice picks to my fucking soul but so yes i side give me the happy ending shit we need to have what's ending b

Sean: 我刚才是不是听到你悲惨地叹了口气？是的，当你提到人工智能那句的时候。你刚才描述的这些，真的就像冰锥刺进了我的灵魂深处。所以是的，我叹气了。给我个快乐的结局吧，该死，我们需要这个，结局 B 是什么？

[00:46:06]

C. Thi Nguyen: i've kind of already given you the happy ending but you might like the reason why two endings so the happy ending is what i said before right like look there are some kind of ways to structure the world that discourage playfulness when we offer simple metrified easily uh countable easily understandable fully pervasive systems this discourages playfulness

C. Thi Nguyen: 我其实已经给了你快乐的结局，但你可能想知道为什么会有两个结局。快乐的结局就是我之前说过的，对吧？听着，有一些构建世界的方式会抑制“游玩的心态 (playfulness)”。当我们提供简单的、指标化的、易于计算、易于理解、且完全无孔不入的系统时，这会扼杀游玩的心态。

[00:46:34]

C. Thi Nguyen: but that gives us a sense of what the other direction is like and it's going to be hard to build but the other direction is to deemphasize largescale pervasive measures and rebuild play in and i mean the the cheerful part of this is for me like how many worlds that are genuinely playful are flourishing right like you know i wandered off into the wilds of the internet and found a community that was interested in like emotionally cathartic like self-exloratory indie role playing games where you like play out codependent relationships that exists too right that's not been squashed like worlds that encourage deep playfulness are also out there and also flourishing

C. Thi Nguyen: 但这也让我们意识到了另一个方向是什么样的。那会很难建立，但另一个方向是淡化大规模、无孔不入的衡量标准，并重新将“游玩的心态”建立起来。对我来说，令人高兴的是，现在依然有那么多真正充满游戏精神的世界正在蓬勃发展，对吧？比如，我在互联网的荒野中漫游，发现了一个对情感宣泄、自我探索式独立角色扮演游戏感兴趣的社区，在里面你可以扮演相互依赖的关系。这玩意也是存在的，对吧？它还没有被压垮。那些鼓励深度游玩心态的世界依然存在，并且也在蓬勃发展。

[00:47:14]

Sean: in a weird way if it's true that metrics don't capture what what really matters or they only capture what's easy to measure then i i have to at least ask you what you think really matters in life and in the spirit of your book i'm not asking you what should matter for everyone in life i'm really asking what matters most to you in your life

Sean: 很奇妙，如果说指标无法捕捉到真正重要的东西，或者它们只能捕捉到容易衡量的东西，那么我至少得问你，你认为生活中真正重要的是什么？本着你那本书的精神，我并不是在问“对所有人来说生活中应该什么是重要的”，我是真的在问，你生命中对你来说最重要的是什么？

[00:47:45]

C. Thi Nguyen: what matters to me there are these moments i i was i've been thinking about all my weird obsessions and all my weird obsessions i realized um everything from cooking to board gaming to like conversations with people they're all built around the moment of epiphany

C. Thi Nguyen: 对我来说什么是重要的……有这样一些时刻，我一直在思考我所有的那些奇怪的痴迷，我意识到，从烹饪到玩桌游，再到和别人交流，所有的这些都是围绕着一种“顿悟的时刻”建立的。

[00:48:01]

C. Thi Nguyen: like when you have this really difficult rock climb and you don't see how you can do it and then you realize oh it's about the balance move my shoulder there and then everything comes together when you do it with your body or when you see all these like weird complicated ideas and you feel like there's some heart to them and you don't have the words is you can finally put it into words that moment of epiphany

C. Thi Nguyen: 比如当你面临一次极其困难的攀岩，你完全不知道该怎么爬上去。然后你突然意识到：哦，关键在于平衡，把肩膀移到那里！然后当你用身体去实践时，一切都顺理成章了。又或者当你看到所有这些怪异复杂的想法，你感觉到它们内部有一个核心，但你却找不到词汇来表达。直到你终于能够用语言把它表述出来的那一瞬间的顿悟。

[00:48:27]

C. Thi Nguyen: and the height of this and i think for me this is probably why i've built my life around the weird way i've built my life the height of this the best thing in life is when you're talking with other people together about some complicated thing and you don't understand it and you keep pushing each other and you keep getting closer and closer and there's a moment where you figure it out together and in your conversation you get exactly the right word exactly the right image and suddenly you're there together understanding the thing that is my meaning of life

C. Thi Nguyen: 这之中的最高境界——我想对我来说，这大概就是为什么我以现在这种怪异的方式来构建我的生活——这种最高境界、生命中最美好的事情，就是：当你和其他人一起讨论某个复杂的事物，你们都不懂，然后你们不断互相推敲，你们靠得越来越近。接着，有那么一个时刻，你们一起弄懂了它。在你们的对话中，你们找到了绝对精准的词汇，绝对准确的意象。突然之间，你们就站在了那里，共同理解了那个事物。那就是我生命的意义。

[00:49:03]

Sean: i'm going to leave it right there this is one of the best books i read this year if not the best it's gonna sit with me i think for a very long time thank you

Sean: 我就要停在这里了。这是我今年读过的最好的书之一，如果不是最好的一本的话。我想它会在我很长一段时间里伴随着我。谢谢你。

[00:49:12]

C. Thi Nguyen: that means and more to me than i could express in any words i have metrics yeah certainly

C. Thi Nguyen: 这对我意义重大，其程度远胜于我能用任何词汇或“指标”所能表达的。是的，绝对的。
